# CryptoBallot

This is a blockchain-based voting web application built using Solidity, JavaScript, and HTML. It runs on a local blockchain using Ganache.

How to Run
1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.	Install Ganache and Metamask.
3.	Start Ganache and connect Metamask to your local blockchain network.
4.	Install the dependencies by running npm install.
5.	Compile the Solidity contracts by running truffle compile.
6.	Migrate the contracts to the blockchain by running truffle migrate.
7.	Start the web app by running npm start.
8.	Access the web app at http://localhost:3000.

Benefits over Traditional Ballot System
1.	Transparency: With a blockchain-based voting system, all votes are recorded on a public ledger that is tamper-proof and transparent. This ensures that the voting process is fair and unbiased.
2.	Security: The use of cryptography and decentralized nodes makes it nearly impossible to manipulate the voting results. This is especially important in an era where hacking and cyberattacks are commonplace.
3.	Efficiency: Blockchain-based voting systems eliminate the need for manual vote counting, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This makes the voting process faster and more efficient.
4.	Accessibility: Blockchain-based voting systems can be accessed from anywhere, making it easier for people to cast their vote. This is particularly beneficial for people who live far from the polling stations or have mobility issues.
5.	Cost-effective: By eliminating the need for paper ballots, manual vote counting, and other expenses associated with traditional voting systems, blockchain-based voting systems can save a significant amount of money.
